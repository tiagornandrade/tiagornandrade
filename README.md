My focus is to solve business problems through Analytics, Data Engineering, and Data Architect.  

I specialize in solving business challenges through the development of data products. I have a strong background in data source structuring using Python, with a focus on projects such as data warehousing, data lakes, ETL/ELT pipelines, as well as experience with streaming and batch processing. I work in cloud environments, such as GCP, for data ingestion, transformation, and accessibility. Additionally, I work as a DataOps professional, contributing to the success of data operations.
